To build the rootfs.tar.gz, run the script in the root of this repo named
`generate-arm-rootfs.sh`.

After you have an archive, copy it in place here, and run "make". If you want
to build a true arm image, download the archive from the CI system, and use
that.
 

It is currently linked to the Gitlab CI runner.
